# Impostor_Game
A program for the Impostor game I saw on the internet, sent by a friend

This is my version of the app for the "Impostor" game from tiktok, which a friend sent in a group. It uses a kind of official app, which I found unnecessary considering how simple the task is. 

##Rules

There is a group of players with a keyword as a theme. Everybody gets shown the keyword except one, who is the impostor. The group go around saying words or terms that are related to or describe the given word. The impostor must try to blend in while participating.
